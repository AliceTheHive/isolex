# Lex

The bot uses [AWS Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) for natural language parsing. This service can process text or
audio input and returns an intent and slots, mapping very closely to the bot's command noun, verb, and data.

## Model

The Lex model is included here. This can be imported to create a chat bot with the `time_get` and `weather_get`
intents.
